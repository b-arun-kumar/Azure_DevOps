NIST characteristics for cloud:
> On demand
	IT resources: (Bare metal) (On premises)
		Compute (servers)
		Storage (local disks, etc)
		Network (bridge, firewall, gateways, routers, etc)
		DB
	Abstraction/Virtualization: Hidden but accessible when required.
> Shared resource pool
> Rapid elasticity
	Scaling: Stretch and squeeze whenever required.
> Broad network access
	Internet
> Metering
	Pricing
	
Stakeholders:
> User
> Cloud service providers
> Auditors
> Brokers
> Carrier

Cloud computing: On demand IT resources through internet

SOA: Service oriented architecture

Cloud computing: Migrate on premises / co - located resources:
> Abstraction/Virtualization
> SOA
> Internet

Cloud:
> Azure
> AWS
> Google
> IBM

Deployment models:
> Public:
	Everything is on cloud.
> Private:
	Everything is on premises.
> Hybrid:
	Public + Private.
> Community

Service models:
Based on the level of abstraction.
> IaaS
	Only infrastructure is provided. Rest is done by user. Lowest level of abstraction. More control. Less convenient.
> PaaS
	Infrastructure and O/S related maintenance, etc is provided.
> SaaS
	Only software is used by user. Rest all is taken care by provider. Ex. Office 365. Highest level of abstraction. Less control. More convenient.

Why cloud services:
> Cost savings (because it is on demand)
> Secure
> Better services to customer
> Undifferentiated availability (cloud related activites are taken by service providers)

Scaling:
> Horizontal:
	Replicate resources. Add more similar resources. Add another server.
> Vertical:
	Increase/Decrease resources. Increase/Decrease capacity. Add more storage to existing server.
	
Advantages:
> Economies of sale:
	Rent resources and try ideas. If unsuccessful, scale down.
> Consumption based model
